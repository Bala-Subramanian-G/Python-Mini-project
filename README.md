# Python-Mini-project

## Motivation:
When I was in the beginning time of my Python learning, I was very curious to implement the concepts in real-time work but also in a funny way. That's where this idea came to my mind.
I started creating mini-games in Python. Some more things are also on my mind. Will be updating them in the future.

Some of my works are
- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/Bala-Subramanian-G/Python-Mini-project/tree/b83f6ecbd9a6b2365bdf4732be036cd709f01a0b/Rock%20Paper%20Scissor)
- [Flames](https://github.com/Bala-Subramanian-G/Python-Mini-project/tree/05ddd6898f5b4932592e3b9cb2021b4e74d3e2f3/FLAMES%20-%20Love%20Calculator)
- Fair coin testing
