Running this code will allow the user to play the **ROCK PAPER SCISSOR** game.

Note: It is requested to run this code either in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** for a better experience.

### Motivation:
The motivation of this work is to give a game-like experience to users in the Python Console itself without the help of web development.

### Future work:
Future work will be implementing this code in either Streamlit  or Flask framework to run this code on the website.
